    <h1>Hey. I'm making us a website.</h1>
    <p>I plan to hide all sorts of <b>NSFW</b> fun stuff here.</p>
    <a href="https://reddit.com/u/GoodTimesGirly"target="_blank" title="NSFW">Like this link to my old Reddit user...</a>
   <p>I decided that instead of wasting my time doing useless stuff on the internet, I could waste my time doing something useful like learning how to code! This is one of the ways I can stay in ouch with you when I am gone, and I can learn something at the same time! Obviously it looks pretty basic right now but maybe one day I will be able to make it more complex.<br>
    <br>
    We can store all of our photos here, and I can write you secret love notes.</p>
